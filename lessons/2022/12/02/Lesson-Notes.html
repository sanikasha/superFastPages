<p>Vocabulary
list: a sequence of several variables grouped together
variable: a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used
data types: a set of values and operations on those values
abstract data types: a data type whose internal representation is hidden from the client
client: a program that uses a data type
objects: a structure that can take on a data-type value
Applications programming interface (API): which is a list of constructors and instance methods or operations, used to specify the behavior of an abstract data type
Elements: individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index. And elements are referenced by an index.
Index: referencing elements in a list or string using natural numbers</p>

<p>Essential Knowledge
The assignment operater allows a program to change the value represented to a variable.
The exam reference sheet uses the “⟵” to use for assignment. For example, Text: a ⟵ expression Then the code would display a block text of “a ⟵ expression”. The code will evaluate expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a.</p>

<p>3.3 and 3.4</p>

<p>Essential Knowledge
Algorithms can be expressed in a variety of ways and can be executed by programs which are implemented using programming languages.
Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration
An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, us as humans, do algorithms on a daily basis.
Sequencing is doing steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc.
Selection is when the programmer decides between two different outcomes.
Iteration is when you have to repeat a step until that condition is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Vocabulary
algorithm- finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, composed of sequencing, selection, and iteration.
selection- a section of code is run only if a condition is met.
iteration- repeating steps or instructions over and over again
sequencing- outline or set of steps that we do and follow in order that they are given
variable- you can store an actual value, the value of a variable in another variable, the result of an operation, or result of a procedural call
String- a sequence of characters</p>
