Actual Score CPT: 4/6

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | While I thought the individual earned the point, I learned that there is an important different between a program purpose and a program function. While a function is what the program does, the purpose is why is was made |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | My response was consistent with college board scoring. The student shows all neccesary aspects of list use, and uses the list in their program|
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The code used needless keys in their list, as they could have just directly defined the string to the function. While theydo use a list, it&#39;s purpose was needless. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | My grade was consistent, the student provides a procedure and describes the function of this procedure |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | There are if/then statements used in their procedure, which classifies as algorithms. College board seemed to appreciate the detail given to explain the steps of the alhorithms |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls, describes conditions being tested for. I would like to increase my understanding of calls, as it is mentioned quite a bit in Row 6 grading. |

| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Unlike the first student, this student specifies WHY they created the program rather than what the program itself does. The video also appropriately displays the program. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student provided all neccesary information, as they makde a list and pull information to help the function of their code. It is important to know that college board does not give extra points or leeway for extra work. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Used list to manage many items, that would be essentially impossible to manage individually |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Made a procedure, described said procedure sufficiently |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Uses iteration and selection (if/else, and loops) |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two different calls, describes conditions being tested, describes results of two calls |
