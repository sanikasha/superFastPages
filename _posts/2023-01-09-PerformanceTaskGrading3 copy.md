<h2>Student 1</h2>

Actual Score CPT: 1/6

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | <ul><li>- [ ] input, program functionality, output </li><li>- [ ] describes the overall purpose of the program. </li></ul>- [ ] describes functionality of the program. </li></ul>- [ ] describes the input and output. </li></ul> |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | <ul><li>- [ ] data stored in list, list being used </li><li>- [ ] identifies variable. </li></ul>- [ ] describes what the data contained in this list is
representing in the program. </li></ul> |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | <ul><li>- [ ] includes segment showing list used to manage complexity </li><li>- [ ] explains how the named, selected list manages
complexity in the program code by explaining why
the program code could not be written, or how it
would be written differently, without using this list. </li></ul> |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | <ul><li>- [ ] student developed procedure with one parameter </li><li>- [ ] procedure called </li></ul>- [ ] describes what the identified procedure does and
how it contributes to the overall functionality of the
program. </li></ul> |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | <ul><li>- [ ] sequencing, selection, iteration </li><li>- [ ] explains in detailed steps how the identified
algorithm works in enough detail that someone else
could recreate it. </li></ul> |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | <ul><li>- [ ] describes two calls to the selected procedure
identified in written response 3c </li><li>- [ ] describes the condition(s) being tested by each call
to the procedure. </li></ul>- [ ] identifies the result of each call. </li></ul> |

<h2>Student 2</h2>

Actual Score CPT: 6/6

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response specifies what want their program was created to fulfill. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The repsonse specifies their use of a list and fetching the information from that list |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response clearly explains why the list was necessary in order to easily randomize their results |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student demonstrated their procedure and explains its function |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student used iteration and selection for their creatPoems procedure, and explains in well enough detail|
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The student fully demonstrates the two calls they utilized |


<h2>Student 3</h2>

Actual Score CPT: 5/6

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The student explains the function, not the purpose. This seems to be a common mistake amongst APCSP students. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response shows data being stored in a list, and that list being accessed for later use. The list is called firstCharacterList |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The code used a list and was able to well explain what would happen if their list were to be not used in the program. In their case, this is reducing the amount of variables used in the program |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response meets guidlines of having a procedure with 2 parameters and fully describing the function of the program. It is important to note that here it asks for the function not purpose.|
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | findWinner includes iteration and selection, and explains in well detail so that the program could be recreated. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls, describes conditions being tested for. It also explains the outputs. |

<h2>Student 4</h2>

Actual Score CPT: 3/6

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Response explains the purpose and function of the program. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | The response shows use of a list named guesses, and how without this list the program would be uneccesarily complex. However, they do not show use of said list, therefore losing the point |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The list does not manage complexity as it could be replaced with a counter, therefore not meeting the criteria. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response shows a procedure developed by the student as well as explaining the significance of the procedure to the function of the program |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Procedure isitcorrect includes sequencing and iteration. It explains in detail enough that the program can be recreated. |
| Testing | 1 | 0 | The student explain the conditions required for certain things to happen, rather than two different "arguments" that would need to be executed. |
