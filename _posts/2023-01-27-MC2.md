Individual: MCQ Test #2 
47/50

Corrections:
Q30 use drawCircle to draw figure on a coordinate grid
When adding, the circle must be draw after r and y are redefined, as opposed to before like when r and y are redefined through subtraction.

Q22 Find average height of students
While I said "Algorithm B always calculates the correct average, but Algorithm A does not.", in actuality both Algorithm A and B always calculate the correct average. This is because either way, all the students' responses are recorded and divided by the number of responses, despite the method in which they are collected.

Q50 ASCII character with hexidecimal
My answer was L, as I guessed and did not understand the question. I feel similarly on this how I felt on binary in the last College Board assesment. The correct answer is V.

Reflection: I found this MC easier than the last, which likely means I have gained a better understanding of APCSP concepts. I have an easier time making sense of a procedure using mental processes, rather than having to write it down.
