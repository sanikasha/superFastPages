<p>Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files.  Describe how these relate to Data Compression ...</p>
<ul>
<li>File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab</li>
</ul>
<p>PNG is more often used for a lossless compression, as it doesn't remove additional pixels or imformation from the image. While this makes the quality of the image better, it doesn't reduce as much space.</p>
<p>JPG is lossy, meaning it can reduce the quality of the image, as it removed extra information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Size, height and width, number of pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are factors which may determine how much space the image takes up, and how much it must be compressed to complete a certain function. These may be factored in when determining which compression method is more appropriate for the situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual perception, lossy compression</li>
</ul>
<p>Lossy and lead to a change in visual perception, sometimes even to the point of distortion.</p>

<li>What are commands you use in terminal to access files?</li>
</ul>
<p>cd:change directoryYou can also use ls to list the files existing in a certain directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files?</li>
</ul>
<p>While I don't have a Windows machine and do not use WSL, I learned from my Scrum mate that WSL also uses cd.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are some of the major differences?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-vs-windows-commands/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-vs-windows-commands/</a>
One major difference is that in linux a directory listing is ls -l, while in windows it is dir. Additionally, linuz using rm to delete a file while WSL uses del. This is an important detail as deleteing a file or moving a file could be important to the functioning of a program.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why is path a big deal when working with images?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Without specifying the path, the program will say there is not such file/image. I ran into this error when modifying images below.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics?</li>
</ul>
<p>Meta data might make data sets more accesible to those who do not have background knowledge in reading code or even reading statistics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images?</li>
</ul>
<p>IPython is a programming shell that allows for the use of multiple different programming languages. This might be useful in Pandas as we use python to interpret a data set in csv or json, and display it in a readable format. For images, we change the image into an array, manipulate it, and then reformat it into an image. The transition might be made possible due to IPython.</p>

Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program.  Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I can pick our several steps and what their function/contribution to the program is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code?</li>
</ul>
<p>The image data is first collected and set to a path so that they may be accessed. The images are then set to their proper size and converted to base64. From this I think the program loops through the pixels in the image, pickes every three pixels, averages their RGB values (which creates a grey color), then coverts the pixels into that color.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe scale image?  What is before and after on pixels in three images?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the scale image downsizes the amount of pixels in the image, as the after is much less pixels than the original image not in gray scale. However, this only happened for the first and last image.
 Image 1:Original size:  (16, 16)Scaled size:  (320, 320)
 Image 2:
Original size:  (320, 234)
Scaled size:  (320, 234)
 Image 3: 
Original size:  (2792, 2094)
Scaled size:  (320, 240)</p>
<ul>
<li>Is scale image a type of compression?  If so, line it up with College Board terms described?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I believe it can be used as a form of compression. I think it does line up with what College Board described, because it either reduces the amount of detail/information and becomes lossy compression, or increasing the amount of pixels without additional information (not compression but might still distort like lossy).</p>

<h2 id="Data-Structures-and-OOP">Data Structures and OOP<a class="anchor-link" href="#Data-Structures-and-OOP"> </a></h2><blockquote><p>Most data structures classes require Object Oriented Programming (OOP).  Since this class is lined up with a College Course,  OOP will be talked about often.  Functionality in remainder of this Blog is the same as the prior implementation.  Highlight some of the key difference you see between imperative and oop styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Read imperative and object-oriented programming on Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<p>In imperative, functions are coded to solve each step/aspect of the problem rather than in OOP which focuses on the object (not functions/logic) to solve the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider how data is organized in two examples, in relations to procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>While the imperative example defines functions and has more clear iteration, more like a math equation. In contrast, OOP uses the characteristics of the object and changes them accordingly. While I don't fully understand the concept yet, I am more easily able to recognise an OOP as opposed to an imperative program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at Parameters in Imperative and Self in OOP</li>
</ul>
<p>Both define a variable or object, that will later be manipulated.</p>

<li>PIL </li>
</ul>
<p>Python Imaging Library, this is an image processing package that allows for the modification of images. From adding text to changing the colors, it gives you control over the visuals involved in a program.</p>
<ul>
<li>numpy</li>
</ul>
<p>A python library used when working with arrays. In context of images, an image can be changes to an array, modified, and then changed back.</p>
<ul>
<li>base64</li>
</ul>
<p>Binary to text encoding which uses 6 text bits and 24 sequences of bits.</p>

<p>Project Addition</p>
<ul>
<li>If your project has images in it, try to implement an image change that has a purpose. (Ex. An item that has been sold out could become gray scale)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pick a programming paradigm and solve some of the following ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Numpy, manipulating pixels.  As opposed to Grey Scale treatment, pick a couple of other types like red scale, green scale, or blue scale.  We want you to be manipulating pixels in the image.</li>
<li>Binary and Hexadecimal reports.  Convert and produce pixels in binary and Hexadecimal and display.</li>
<li>Compression and Sizing of images.  Look for insights into compression Lossy and Lossless.  Look at PIL library and see if there are other things that can be done.</li>
<li>There are many effects you can do as well with PIL. Blur the image or write Meta Data on screen, aka Title, Author and Image size.</li>

<h2 id="College-Board-Hacks">College Board Hacks<a class="anchor-link" href="#College-Board-Hacks"> </a></h2><h3>Data Compression</h3><ol>
<li>Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm?</li>
</ol>
<p>A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot.</p>
<ol>
<li>A user wants to save a data file on an online storage site. The user wants to reduce the size of the file, if possible, and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version. Which of the following actions best supports the user’s needs?</li>
</ol>
<p>Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it.</p>
<ol>
<li>A programmer is developing software for a social media platform. The programmer is planning to use compression when users send attachments to other users. Which of the following is a true statement about the use of compression?</li>
</ol>
<p>Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does.</p>
<h3>Using Programs with Data Quiz</h3><ol>
<li>Which of the following expressions will evaluate to true if the book should be counted and evaluates to false otherwise?</li>
</ol>
<p>(genre = "mystery") AND ((1 ≤ num) AND (cost &lt; 10.00))</p>
<ol>
<li>Using only the data collected during the 7-day period, which of the following statements is true?</li>
</ol>
<p>The total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined by searching the data for all transactions that occurred on the given date and then adding the number of items purchased for each matching transaction.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which of the following best explains how the data files in the table can be used to send a targeted e-mail to only those customers who have purchased products that use AA batteries to let them know about the new accessory?</li>
</ol>
<p>Use the products file to generate a list of product IDs that use AA batteries, then use the list of product IDs to search the purchases file to generate a list of customer IDs, then use the list of customer IDs to search the customers file to generate a list of e-mail addresses</p>
<ol>
<li>Assume that applying either of the filters will not change the relative order of the rows remaining in the spreadsheet. Which of the following sequences of steps can be used to identify the desired entry?</li>
</ol>
<p>Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year</p>
<p>Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer</p>
<p>CORRECTION:</p>
<p>Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year</p>
<p>Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer</p>
<ol>
<li>Which of the following expressions will evaluate to true if the show should be counted and evaluates to false otherwise?</li>
</ol>
<p>(genre = "talk") AND ((day = "Saturday") OR (day = "Sunday"))</p>
<ol>
<li>Which of the following explains how the two databases can be used to develop the interactive exhibit?</li>
</ol>
<p>Both databases are needed. Each database can be searched by animal name to find all information to be displayed.</p>
<h3>Lossy</h3><p>JPG like negatives.jpg I use below.</p>
<h3>Lossless</h3><p>PNG like the skin1.png I use below.</p>
