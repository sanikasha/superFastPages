Q1

In the following procedure, the parameter max is a positive integer.

PROCEDURE printNums(max)
{
count ← 1
REPEAT UNTIL(count > max)
{
DISPLAY(count)
count ← count + 2
}
}

Which of the following is the most appropriate documentation to appear with the printNums procedure?

Prints all positive odd integers that are less than or equal to max.

Q2

In the following procedure, the parameters x and y are integers.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/q2prog1.2.png)

Which of the following is the most appropriate documentation to appear with the calculate procedure?

Displays the value of (x + y) / x.
The value of the parameter x must not be 0.

Q3

In the following procedure, the parameter numList is a list of numbers and the parameters j and k are integers.

PROCEDURE swapListElements(numList, j, k)
{
newList ← numList
newListj ← numListk
newListk ← numListj
RETURN(newList)
}

Which of the following is the most appropriate documentation to appear with the swapListElements procedure?

Interchanges the values of the parameters j and k.
The value of j must be between 0 and the value of k, inclusive.

1.3 Program Design and Development Quiz: 4/6

Q1
Consider the following code segment.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/1.3q1.png)

Which of the following best describes the behavior of the code segment?

The code segment displays the value of  2(5^3)  by initializing result to 2 and then multiplying result by 5 a total of three times.

Q2
In the following procedure, assume that the parameter x is an integer.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/1.3q2.png)

Which of the following best describes the behavior of the procedure?

It displays true if x is negative and displays nothing otherwise.

Q3
DineOutHelper is a mobile application that people can use to select a restaurant for a group meal. Each user creates a profile with a unique username and a list of food allergies or dietary restrictions. Each user can then build a contact list of other users of the app.

A user who is organizing a meal with a group selects all the members of the group from the user’s contact list. The application then recommends one or more nearby restaurants based on whether the restaurant can accommodate all of the group members’ allergies and dietary restrictions.

Suppose that Alejandra is using DineOutHelper to organize a meal with Brandon and Cynthia.

Which of the following data are needed for DineOutHelper to recommend a restaurant for the group?

I. Each group member’s list of food allergies or dietary restrictions
II. Alejandra’s geographic location
III. The usernames of the people on Brandon and Cynthia’s contact lists

I and II only

Q4
DineOutHelper is a mobile application that people can use to select a restaurant for a group meal. Each user creates a profile with a unique username and a list of food allergies or dietary restrictions. Each user can then build a contact list of other users of the app.

A user who is organizing a meal with a group selects all the members of the group from the user’s contact list. The application then recommends one or more nearby restaurants based on whether the restaurant can accommodate all of the group members’ allergies and dietary restrictions.

Suppose that Alejandra is using DineOutHelper to organize a meal with Brandon and Cynthia.

Which of the following data is not provided by Alejandra but is necessary for DineOutHelper to recommend a restaurant for the group?

I. Brandon’s contact list
II. Information about which restaurants Brandon and Cynthia have visited in the past
III. Information about which food allergies and dietary restrictions can be accommodated at different restaurants near Alejandra

II and III only

Q5
A student wrote the following code segment, which displays true if the list myList contains any duplicate values and displays false otherwise.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/1.3q5.png)

The code segment compares pairs of list elements, setting containsDuplicates to true if any two elements are found to be equal in value. Which of the following best describes the behavior of how pairs of elements are compared?

The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to all other elements in the list.

Q6
A student is creating an application that allows customers to order food for delivery from a local restaurant. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be an input provided by a customer using the application?

The cost of a food item currently available for order
