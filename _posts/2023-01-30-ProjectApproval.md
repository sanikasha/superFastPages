Describe portion of Project you will use for Create Performance task: 

Plan:
| Reporting Category | Plan |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | Help people of all ages to gain a thorough understanding of their own skin, and therefore increase their self-confidence. Use dictionaries, keys, and lists to fetch multiple product recommendations from an API |
| Data Abstraction | Products stored in list in flask repo deployed on AWS, variables will be determined by user input (dry skin/not dry skin)|
| Managing Complexity | Algorithm to provide multiple results to user input, rather than seperate correspondents |
| Procedural Abstraction | Procedure called when user clicks submit to the quiz, ensure to describe the procedure |
| Algorithm Implementation | Use iteration and selection to select the proper item from the list in the API, and display it on frontend for user use |
| Testing | Explain thouroughly, show input and output |

Video Plan:
- Sped-up (but still understandable)
- Shows submitting input, and shows result
- Possibly show API where output was fetched from
- Video less than 1 minute
