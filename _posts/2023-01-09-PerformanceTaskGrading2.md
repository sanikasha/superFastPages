<h2>Student 1</h2>

Actual Score CPT: 1/6

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | Explains function not purpose, tone is informal |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | A list is identified, but it doesn't seemed to be used in the program|
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The program does not use items in the list, and therefore does not use it as a way to manage complexity |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Describes what the procedure does, but not how it contributes to overall functionality of ther program |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The program includes selection and iteration, but description is not sufficient. College baord mentions how it must be detailed enough that someone else can recreate it |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The student sufficiently tested their program, and proves that it works how it claims to |

<h2>Student 2</h2>

Actual Score CPT: 6/6

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response specifies what want their program was created to fulfill. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The repsonse specifies their use of a list and fetching the information from that list |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The response clearly explains why the list was necessary in order to easily randomize their results |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student demonstrated their procedure and explains its function |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student used iteration and selection for their creatPoems procedure, and explains in well enough detail|
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The student fully demonstrates the two calls they utilized |


<h2>Student 3</h2>

Actual Score CPT: 5/6

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The student explains the function, not the purpose. This seems to be a common mistake amongst APCSP students. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response shows data being stored in a list, and that list being accessed for later use. The list is called firstCharacterList |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The code used a list and was able to well explain what would happen if their list were to be not used in the program. In their case, this is reducing the amount of variables used in the program |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response meets guidlines of having a procedure with 2 parameters and fully describing the function of the program. It is important to note that here it asks for the function not purpose.|
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | findWinner includes iteration and selection, and explains in well detail so that the program could be recreated. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls, describes conditions being tested for. It also explains the outputs. |

<h2>Student 4</h2>

Actual Score CPT: 3/6

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Response explains the purpose and function of the program. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | The response shows use of a list named guesses, and how without this list the program would be uneccesarily complex. However, they do not show use of said list, therefore losing the point |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The list does not manage complexity as it could be replaced with a counter, therefore not meeting the criteria. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response shows a procedure developed by the student as well as explaining the significance of the procedure to the function of the program |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Procedure isitcorrect includes sequencing and iteration. It explains in detail enough that the program can be recreated. |
| Testing | 1 | 0 | The student explain the conditions required for certain things to happen, rather than two different "arguments" that would need to be executed. |
