<h2> Q6 contents of an Internet packet </h2>

Each packet contains metadata in addition to the traditional data, and does not contain an encrypted version of the data.

<h2> Q8 Simulating packets traveling from server to client </h2>

While I got one answer correct, I missed the aspect of a simulation that provides a better understanding of the impact of increased connection speeds for frequently visited servers.m

<h2> Q39 Displaying random values in a loop </h2>

This was a question I struggled to understand a bit more than the others. While I picked 1 1 1 1, the college board explanation for why this was incorrect consisted of: Incorrect. The first number displayed must be 1. The second number displayed could be 1 or 2. The third number displayed could be 1, 2, or 3. The last number displayed could be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So 1 1 1 1 is a possible output. The correct answer is 1 3 2 4.
