Many of these questions were repeated from the final, so the quiz was a bit more simple than previous ones. However, these repeated questions helped confirm my understanding of these topics, while allowing me to review topics I still need to work on. The main topic I struggle with understanding is binary, so I will make sure to review this throughout our production of out NATM project as well as our lesson.

<h2>Q19 Filtering and sorting restaurant data</h2>

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images1/bigideas22.png)

Because the order of the rows do not change, it is okay to sort by rating, then filter by number of ratings, then filter by payment type. 

<h2>Q25 Effect of appending three zeros to a binary number</h2>

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images1/bigideas21.png)

Because adding the number 0 multiplies the number by 2, adding three zeros would mean multiplying the number by 2 three times (therefore multiplying the number by 8).
