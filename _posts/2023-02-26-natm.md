title: Night at the Museum Trimester 2

We began Night at the Museum by presenting our own progress. Because we initially had difficulty with deployment, we were is little behind on making sure our user input worked. However, we were able to make it so that output was given in the console, but not available to the user.

The reason for this is that we are new to the language of JavaScript, and are still learning syntax. I have now learned that console.log displays the output when we inspect the page.

After sharing our own project, we visited Ceramics. It was absolutely fascinating how each student expressed themselves differently through art. The image above is the work of one of my closest friends. I believe this gave me a greater insight into the project because I know what the piece is based on. The ceramic materializes a lyric in the song Moon Song by Phoebe Bridgers.

This piece was an AP Studio Art "sculpture". These ceramics are beautifully made, and you can see the immense detail that was put into the designs. I also have the privilege of knowing the artist and knowing that another one of the pieces is based on a song. The song is Burning Hill by Mitski, which I know is very dear to the artist. I found it interesting how AP Studi Art students are able to pick their medium and have greater freedom in how they want to express themselves.

This is also a piece from AP Studio Art, except it is a mixed-medium drawing. These drawings show perfect technique and an artist who genuinely has something to say. While the top drawing is more difficult to read as someone who expresses themselves through music more than physical art. But the bottom left drawing can be seen to be making a statement on body image. It portrays the impacts of body dysmorphia and allows the user to empathize with both the artists and people who have similar experiences.

Another AP Studio Art piece shows a photography display of various skincare products, which we found interesting because they relate to our project! We opted to take a fun selfie to document this intersection between our project and an AP Studio Art person's project.

Once thoroughly visiting art classrooms such as Digital Media, in addition to AP Studio Art and Ceramics, we returned to see the projects of Computer Science A students. It was really cool to see how they implement things we learn in CSP, but elevate them using novel concepts they learn in CSA. A pattern we observed is that CSA students often use more variables in their function, making it more complex and difficult to manage (and therefore need to manage this complexity).

In this picture, you can see we are very impressed with their front end! We also enjoyed how they were able to simplify difficult subjects that we had not yet covered in CSP. If I wasn't a senior, I would take CSA to become as knowledgeable as these students!
