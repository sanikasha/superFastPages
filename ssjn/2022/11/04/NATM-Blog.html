<p>After completeing and personalizing our project, we were excited to share it with atendees of Night at The Museum.</p>

<p>Because we arrived early, our first participants (our friends) used our personal computer to explore our Song-by-Emotion generator. We explained to them how each aspect of our project connects, and simplified the concepts of frontend and backend.</p>

<p>Once we were able to connect to a larger display, we explained our program to larger groups of people. They found it interesting, and often understoof how it worked due to having prior computer science knowlege.</p>

<p>After demonstrating our project to a variety of peers and parents, we found a few points of improvement.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add more synonyms so that user has more leeway for input (more specific emotions)</li>
  <li>More specific instructions so that user is able to understand purpose better</li>
  <li>Frontend to improve appearance</li>
</ol>

<p>After finishing our own presentation, we explored projects from other groups in APCSP and APCSA.</p>

<p>Some included marketplace to sell personal items, stopwatches to help studying, and arcade games.</p>
