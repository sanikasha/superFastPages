    <p><strong>Q31 Character in a list of strings</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sanikasha.github.io/superFastPages/assets/img/2022-11-08-CSP-Final-MC-Blog/media/image4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My answer: e</p>

<p>Why is my answer incorrect?</p>

<p>My answer, e, is at index 2 of wordList. The character of index 2 at myWord when myWord is index 2 of wordList, would be e. However, we are observing index 3 of wordList.</p>

<p>Correct answer: h</p>

<p>Why is it correct?</p>

<p>The correct answer, h, is at the correct index 3 of wordList. Therefore the character at index 2 of myWord, is h.</p>

<p><strong>Q36 Store even numbers in evenList</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sanikasha.github.io/superFastPages/assets/img/2022-11-08-CSP-Final-MC-Blog/media/image7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My answer:</p>

<p>i ← i + 1</p>

<p>APPEND (evenList, 2 * i)</p>

<p>Why is my answer incorrect?</p>

<p>This would be the correct solution if i was initialized to 0 instead of 1.</p>

<p>Correct answer:</p>

<p>APPEND (evenList, 2 * i)</p>

<p>i ← i + 1</p>

<p>Why is it correct?</p>

<p>Because i is initialized to 1, in order to begin with 2, it must be multiplied by 2 prior to the addition of 1.</p>

<p><strong>Q38 Update values of three words</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sanikasha.github.io/superFastPages/assets/img/2022-11-08-CSP-Final-MC-Blog/media/image3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My answer:</p>

<p>temp ← word1</p>

<p>word1 ← word2</p>

<p>word2 ← word3</p>

<p>word3 ← temp</p>

<p>Why is my answer incorrect?</p>

<p>It changes word1 to yarn rather than zebra, and changes word2 when word2 was supposed to stay constant.</p>

<p>Correct answer:</p>

<p>temp ← word1</p>

<p>word1 ← word3</p>

<p>word3 ← temp</p>

<p>Why is it correct?</p>

<p>It switches the output of word1 and word3, as the prompt asks.</p>

<p><strong>Q47 Values of variable after arithmetic operations</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sanikasha.github.io/superFastPages/assets/img/2022-11-08-CSP-Final-MC-Blog/media/image8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My answer:</p>

<p>21 40 30 40</p>

<p>Why is my answer incorrect?</p>

<p>We did not use pemdas, and therefore calculated d for (c+d)/2</p>

<p>Correct answer:</p>

<p>21 40 30 50</p>

<p>Why is it correct?</p>

<p>c+(d/2) = 50</p>

<p><strong>Q8 Documentation for procedure with lists</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sanikasha.github.io/superFastPages/assets/img/2022-11-08-CSP-Final-MC-Blog/media/image5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Explanation: The procedure interchanges j and k and returns a copy. Because j and k are integers, they must be between 1 and LENGTH(numList)</p>

<p><strong>Q19 Adding numbers in 4-bit representation</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sanikasha.github.io/superFastPages/assets/img/2022-11-08-CSP-Final-MC-Blog/media/image2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Explanation: Largest binary number that can be represented with 4 bits is 1111, which is 15. 29 is greater than 15.</p>

<p><strong>Q20 Bits needed to represent directions</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sanikasha.github.io/superFastPages/assets/img/2022-11-08-CSP-Final-MC-Blog/media/image6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Explanation: Four bits can represent 2^4, which is 16 data pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Q22 Decimal value not equal to given binary</strong></p>
