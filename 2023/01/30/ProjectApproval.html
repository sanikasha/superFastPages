<p>My portion of our CPT that I will submit to college board will consist of one of the 5 features of our site. Ideally, this will be one of the features that requires fetch from an API, so that I may utilize lists, iteration, and selection (display on frontend).</p>

<p>Individual: Project Blog links added to review ticket.</p>

<p>Describe portion of Project you will use for Create Performance task:</p>

<p>Plan:
| Reporting Category | Plan |
| ———– | ———– |
| Program Purpose and Function | Help people of all ages to gain a thorough understanding of their own skin, and therefore increase their self-confidence. Use dictionaries, keys, and lists to fetch multiple product recommendations from an API |
| Data Abstraction | Products stored in list in flask repo deployed on AWS, variables will be determined by user input (dry skin/not dry skin)|
| Managing Complexity | Algorithm to provide multiple results to user input, rather than seperate correspondents |
| Procedural Abstraction | Procedure called when user clicks submit to the quiz, ensure to describe the procedure |
| Algorithm Implementation | Use iteration and selection to select the proper item from the list in the API, and display it on frontend for user use |
| Testing | Explain thouroughly, show input and output |</p>

<p>Video Plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sped-up (but still understandable)</li>
  <li>Shows submitting input, and shows result</li>
  <li>Possibly show API where output was fetched from</li>
  <li>Video less than 1 minute</li>
</ul>
